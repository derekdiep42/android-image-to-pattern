No images were used in the making of this application.<br />
Inspiration was taken from some of the public repositories open to us by this course, including:<br />
https://git.uwaterloo.ca/j2avery/cs349-public/-/tree/master/09.Android/5.PanZoom<br />
https://git.uwaterloo.ca/j2avery/cs349-public/-/tree/master/09.Android/8.ListView<br />

With help of piazza, some code was also taken from these links:<br />

The app is the exact same as the description. You can do one stroke to make a gesture in the addition page.<br />
You can view and delete gestures in the library page, and you can test gestures against strokes on the test/home page.<br />
